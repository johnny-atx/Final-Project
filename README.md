# Red vs Blue Project 3
This is a project to test ELKs Kibana Visualization platform to assure it is receiving system and network logs for monitoring a vulnerable Word Press web server and SQL database.
After setting up alert thresholds, an enumeration attack was launched at vulnerable Target 1 VM to see if alerts were triggered. Results were compiled into three reports: Offensive, Defensive and Network reports. Soon to come will be a slide show report of the entire engagement.
